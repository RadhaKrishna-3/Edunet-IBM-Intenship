# 📊 Employee Salary Prediction with Random Forest

A machine learning-powered **web application** that predicts employee salary categories based on demographic and professional attributes. Built with **Streamlit** and powered by a trained **Random Forest Classifier**, this app offers users a quick and interactive way to classify salaries.

🧠 What This App Does
👤 User Input
Through a friendly web form interface, the user provides key information about a person such as:
- Age
- Occupation
- Education
- Work class
- Hours-per-week
- Other personal and job-related details

### 🔍 Model Prediction
- The app uses a **pre-trained machine learning model** (`best_model.pkl`)
- The model predicts the likely **salary category** (e.g., `50K`)
- Built using **Scikit-learn** Random Forest, optimized with accuracy/recall

### 💡 Use Cases
- HR analytics tools
- Showcase ML projects in interviews/portfolios
- Experimental platform for custom salary modeling
